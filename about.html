      <h1 class="section-title">A UK-based technology company</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        TA Solutions Ltd focuses on building and operating modern digital platforms that
        combine strong product thinking, robust engineering and regulatory compliance.

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          TA Solutions Ltd is a privately held company registered in the United Kingdom.
          We work at the intersection of digital products, infrastructure and operations, with
          a particular interest in creator platforms, real estate technology and healthcare systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our background spans product design, software development and service operations.
          That mix allows us to design platforms that don’t just look good on paper but can be
          managed day-to-day by real teams in real environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work in an iterative and collaborative way – shipping usable versions early,
          gathering feedback, and continuously improving based on real usage and performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Our principles</h2>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Innovation that solves real problems.</strong><br />
            Every product starts with a clearly defined problem, not just a trend or buzzword.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance and security by design.</strong><br />
            We aim to embed governance, privacy and security into the architecture from the outset.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalable, reliable platforms.</strong><br />
            We favour pragmatic architecture and clarity over unnecessary complexity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Human-focused development.</strong><br />
            Products are built around the needs of creators, operators and customers – not the tech itself.
          </li>
        </ul>
