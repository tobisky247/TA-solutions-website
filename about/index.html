    <div class="grid-2" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">

        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          TA Solutions Ltd is a digital technology company based in the United Kingdom. 
          We specialise in taking platform ideas from early concept to fully-operational products —
          blending product strategy, design, engineering and long-term operational support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our work spans creator platforms, AI-powered tools, marketplaces, booking systems,
          and digital products designed for scale and reliability.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We partner with founders, operators, early-stage teams and established organisations who
          want to build modern, user-centred technology with real-world performance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>
          We combine product thinking with practical delivery. That means defining clear problem
          statements, mapping user journeys, validating assumptions, and delivering fast, high-quality
          releases with a focus on usability and long-term maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every project is approached holistically — from UX and accessibility, to engineering reliability,
          privacy, compliance, infrastructure and ongoing operations.
